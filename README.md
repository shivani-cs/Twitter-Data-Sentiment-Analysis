# Twitter-Data-Sentiment-Analysis

This project deals with analysing sentiments behind the tweets be it positive, negative or neutral, regarding political events. System does sentiment classification of tweets using supervised machine-learning approach in python. 
A web application developed using flask in python displays these results of sentiment analysis in the form of various graphs like line graphs, maps, pie chart etc. Focus is not only on classifying the tweets, but also on making this task faster and more accurate by removing the parts of the tweets not contributing to the sentiment analysis, with the help of data pre-processing techniques.
These pre-processing techniques include case conversion, punctuation removal, stopword removal, URL removal etc.
